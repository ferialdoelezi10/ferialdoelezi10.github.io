            <p>This is the official SmartVille repository</p>
            <p>Smartville is an open-source testbed based on GNS3, Pytorch, and Docker for training and testing online
                intrusion detection systems based on machine learning.</p>
            <p>Feel free to contribute!</p>
            <p>The related paper <em>"SmartVille: an open-source SDN online-intrusion detection testbed"</em> is under
                review. Stay tuned!</p>

        <h2>Docker Containers</h2>
        <p>A Docker container characterizes each node in the SmartVille testbed. The container images are
            buildable using the corresponding Dockerfiles that handle all the dependencies and the nodes'
            internal file-system structure.</p>
        <p>This example of code represents the Dockerfile of each victim node. It's possible to identify four
            main Docker containers in our testbed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> All the dependencies to run the controller and a suite of
                networking tools are installed. The POX library and PyTorch are retrieved and set to the
                gar-experimental branch. Kafka, Grafana, and Prometheus tools are retrieved and ports 9090,
                9092, and 3000 are exposed to allow the instance of the three servers. Lastly, the script
                entrypoint.sh, which keeps the application alive, is run.</li>
            <li><strong>Victim:</strong> All the dependencies to run the victim behavior are installed (Python3,
                TCP Replay, Scapy, Kafka, network tools) and the victim's scripts are imported into the file
                system.</li>
            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> All the dependencies to run the attacker behavior are installed
                (Python3, TCP Replay, Scapy, Kafka, network tools) and the scripts of the different cyberattacks
                are copied into the file system.</li>
            <li><strong>Switch:</strong> The container of the OpenVSwitch is based on the official GNS3
                OpenVSwitch appliance. However, the boot kernel has been modified to suit our application
                scenario via the boot.sh script.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Docker containers can be modified to match the configuration of every desired device that needs
            to be emulated in the network topology.</p>

        <h3>OpenFlow Switch</h3>
        <p>The OpenVSwitch is based on the GNS3 appliance, but the boot kernel is modified at launch by the
            boot.sh script:</p>
        <p>The last part of the script sets the switch to listen for a controller on physical port br0 with IP
            address 192.168.1.1 port 6633. This part can be modified to fit the desired IP range case scenario.
        </p>
        <p>OpenFlow switches operate based on a set of high-level commands defined by the OpenFlow protocol,
            providing a flexible and programmable approach to network management. When an OpenFlow controller
            issues OpenFlow commands, such as flow table modifications or routing instructions, the switch
            processes these directives to define its forwarding behavior. The switch maintains a flow table that
            stores rules specifying how to handle incoming packets. Each rule is characterized by a set of
            fields that identify the sender, the receiver, the used communication protocol, and a set of actions
            to perform when the switch receives a packet that matches those fields. Each time a packet is
            received by the switch, it consults its flow table to determine the appropriate action to perform,
            such as forwarding, dropping, or modifying the packet.</p>
        <p>If none of the rules match the packet's parameters, a flow miss occurs. The packet is sent to the
            controller, which has to build and send back an appropriate OpenFlow command to the switch. This
            ensures that the next time a similar packet arrives, it will trigger a flow hit and be handled
            directly by the switch. This paradigm allows for dynamic network behavior adjustments, as the
            controller can remotely instruct switches to adapt to changing network conditions. OpenFlow's
            separation of the control and data planes empowers administrators to centrally manage and
            orchestrate network policies, enabling agility and responsiveness in modern network infrastructures.
