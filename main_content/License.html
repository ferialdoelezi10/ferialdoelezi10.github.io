            <h3>Definitions.</h3>
            <p><strong>"License"</strong> shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
                distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.</p>

                owner that is granting the License.</p>
            <p><strong>"Legal Entity"</strong> shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that
                control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this
                definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
                of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more
                of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>
            <p><strong>"You" (or "Your")</strong> shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
                granted by this License.</p>
            <p><strong>"Source" form</strong> shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but

            <p><strong>"Object" form</strong> shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
                translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated
                documentation, and conversions to other media types.</p>
            <p><strong>"Work"</strong> shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
                available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to
                the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>
            <p><strong>"Derivative Works"</strong> shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
                based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
                purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
                merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
            <p><strong>"Contribution"</strong> shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of
                the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
                intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
                individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes
                of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
                mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
                behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
                communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner
                as "Not a Contribution."</p>
            <p><strong>"Contributor"</strong> shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
                whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
            <h3>Grant of Copyright License.</h3>
            <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
                perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
                reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
                distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
            <h3>Grant of Patent License.</h3>
            <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
                perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
                section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
                the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
                are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
                against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or
                a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
                then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
                date such litigation is filed.</p>
            <h3>Redistribution.</h3>
            <p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
                or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
                conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;
                    and</li>
                <li>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
                    files; and</li>
                <li>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>
                <li>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative
                    Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
                    Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with
                    the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever
                    such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
                    purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
                    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
                    Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
                    License.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
                different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
                or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of
                the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
            <h3>Submission of Contributions.</h3>
            <p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
                Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
                additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
                Contributions.</p>
            <h3>Trademarks.</h3>
            <p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
                names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin
                of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
            <h3>Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3>
            <p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
                KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
                TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
                responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                risks associated.</p>
